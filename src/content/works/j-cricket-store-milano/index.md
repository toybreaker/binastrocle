This project follows the first store opened in Beijing in 2019 and the acquisition of an independent three-storey building located in a historic courtyard in the Milanese Porta Venezia district. Through the choice of the materials and the patterns of floors that vary on each level, the design of fixed furniture such as the employee kitchen, the engineering of the iron clothes hanging racks as well as the choice of the color palette of each room, the renewed spaces become the backdrop that welcomes both the visitors and the colorful and eclectic imagery of designer Jimin Lee's collection of clothes, books, furniture and objects.
