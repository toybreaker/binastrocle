[UnaBox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlnLVAajYLs) is a tiny secret case - inspired by an even smaller Indian box - that was designed and built as a gift for a six months old baby.

Made of olive tree wood, it is meant to last forever and was conceived to store and hide precious things thanks to a security mechanism that doesnâ€™t feature any conventional key, but can only be accessed by patient and curious people.
