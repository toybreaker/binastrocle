Through brutal demolitions, hardy excavations and daring structural steelworks, an existing row house with a fairly small footprint has been utterly transformed inside - though barely restored outside - and brought to new life.

The dwelling is organised on five storeys, two of which below ground, connected by an iron  decagonal stairwell-elevator. Each floor features autonomous materials, furniture and artworks and establishes a specific relationship with the private garden on the rear.
