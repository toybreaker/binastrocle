Conceived as a domestic and a monumental place at the same time, our stand for Tacchini at the Salone Internazionale del Mobile accompanies the visitor through a sequence of rooms of different shapes and sizes, a series of protected spaces in continuous communication with each other and with the outside. Since the most important piece presented by Tacchini during the design week was Mario Belliniâ€™s Le Mura we got inspired by the furniture name to define a modular unit - a large ideal brick - and to endlessly repeat it on every vertical surface as a decorative masonry pattern.
