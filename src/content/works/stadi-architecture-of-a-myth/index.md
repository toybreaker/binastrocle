Set up for the exhibition ‘Stadi. Architecture of a Myth’, a comprehensive overview of stadium architecture and social significance throughout history organised by the MAXXI Museum in Rome. The numerous and diverse items selected by the curators were displayed on basic structures conceived as stands. Through a reversal of perspective and thanks to some carefully arranged scenic devices - including video installations by Douglas Gordon and Yuri Ancarani - visitors find themselves walking across an imaginary pitch, observed by stands packed with the exhibition's contents.
