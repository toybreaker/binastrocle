'Oh Shit' is an art installation conceived by Dan Colen as part of 'Karma', his first solo show in Milan that took place at the Massimo De Carlo Gallery in 2010.

In order to build his 13.5-m-long, 4.2-m-wide and 5.2-m-tall overturned skateboard ramp, the American artist made use of our experience and skills with wood to develop and engineer this temporary construction.
