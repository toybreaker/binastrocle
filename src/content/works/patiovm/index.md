This small patio is the center around which the Milanese flat of an italian architect and his French wife is articulated and organized.

Placed on the ground level on the rear of a large court, the apartmentâ€™s sole source of light is this outdoor space with its vegetation planted around the perimeter and its pavement characterized by randomly placed wooden blocks.
