In 2016 Massimo De Carlo opened his second gallery in Milan.
The 120 sqm venue is located inside Palazzo Belgioioso, a historical building designed by Giuseppe Piermarini and considered a remarkable example of Milanese Neoclassicism.

The careful restoration of the existing materials and finishings, as well as the development of a new discreet lighting system consisting of skinny movable rods, have been - albeit barely visible -  the two main interventions in this very subtle project.
