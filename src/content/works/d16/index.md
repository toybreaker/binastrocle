This 150 sqm workshop is part of a former industrial area that was previously subdivided and transformed into a lively neighborhood featuring a variety of commercial spaces and offices. Unlike other lofts, the D16 unit had never been renovated until its owners decided to put it on income. Through an extensive renovation, which included the replacement of skylights, the installation of mechanical and electrical systems as well as the insertion of a mezzanine composed of a steel frame and CLT slabs, the space was renovated without losing its industrial character.
