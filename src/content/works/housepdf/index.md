Renovation of a 40 sqm studio flat on the top floor of a condominium set in a former convent from the beginning of the last century.

The existing vaulted ceilings, the traditional concrete tiles and the friendly window filled by a big plane tree were the significant features of this space. A lengthy closet in osb panels, an intrusive concrete bench and a precipitous mahogany ladder towards a tiny attic bedroom were the main interventions of the project.
