TACCHINI STAND 2024

To present the Tacchini brand, a dreamlike and eclectic collection of precious re-editions of historical pieces and contemporary furniture on the verge between serial production and collectible design, we have conceived a stand that alludes to the generous and well-proportioned space of an elegant urban apartment. A large corridor crosses the entire length of the 300 sqm rectangular area and separates the four large exhibition rooms, located on the most exposed side flanked by one of the public corridors, from a more private lounge reserved to retailers and clients. The display halls, distinguished by a refined selection of colours and materials, feature different heights which give rise to a sequence of spaces identical in plan but different in proportions which can be perceived from the outside as a sequence of volumes placed side by side.
