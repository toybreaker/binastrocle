Architetto milanese’ organised by Triennale Milano in collaboration with Fondazione studio museo Vico Magistretti","Set up for the exhibition ‘Vico Magistretti. Architetto milanese’ organised by Triennale Milano in collaboration with Fondazione studio museo Vico Magistretti in occasion of the centenary of the architect’s birth.\n\nThe main structures - a large table, a long shelf/wall and a gigantic hood - are designed as blow-ups of domestic archetypes, organise the exhibition space and allude to a place in which to work, design, think, stay and live. A single construction system and a single material confer unity and recognisability to the installation.\n\n\n|:-------------|:-----------------------|\n| Location:    | Milano, Italy          |\n| Client:      | Triennale Milano       |\n| Year:        | 2021                   |\n| Status:      | Completed|\n| Program:     | Exhibition Design|\n| Team:        | Giulio Giori, Anna Pierotello, Marina Tangari|\n| Photographs: | Delfino Sisto Legnani / DSL Studio|","src/content/works/vico-magistretti-architetto-milanese/index.md","274fc73557dc7d26",{"html":455,"metadata":456},"\u003Cp>Set up for the exhibition ‘Vico Magistretti.
